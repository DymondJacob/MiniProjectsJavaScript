# Mini Projects JavaScript 
( Includes HTML / CSS )

# Why I created this
I created this Repository for myself and any developer looking to read through some JavaScript code.

# What type of projects?
These Projects range from Beginner - Intermediate - Advanced ( I'll put what type it is in the README for that project ;) )
They will be a wide range of what you can accomplish in HTML / CSS / JavaScript. 
Some projects will also incorporate Libraries, ( Intermediate / Advanced )

# My Goal
The goal for myself is to write one small(or large) project a day before/after diving into deeper learning. 
Mainly to get the brain going & to put what I learned that day into a project.

# The Goal for YOU!
Yes you!, Take a look at all the projects or anyone that interests you. 
Try to recreate them from scratch and/or just read them through.
Put your own twist on them, ...add some CSS, ...add a Library, anything! 

# TUTORIAL PURGATORY BE GONE!
Don't get stuck in Tutorial Purgatory! I myself had to dig out of that..
The best way to get out of it?... BUILD BUILD BUILD!
Take what you learn from those tutorials and put them into a project! That way it will 'stick' easier.

# Hope You Enjoy!
